# Universal Naming Convention

**Effective Date**: 2026-02-15 22:55 EST

## Policy

All future modifications to code, documentation, and comments in this repository and related projects shall use the honorific **"Sir"** instead of the personal name **"Daniel"**.

## Rationale

- "Sir" is a universal, gender-neutral honorific
- Appropriate for all users and contexts
- Maintains professional documentation
- Applies across all agent frameworks (OpenClaw, LangChain, Agent Zero, generic)

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- Code comments
- Documentation files (README.md, SKILL.md, etc.)
- Configuration files
- Example code
- Commit messages
- Pull request descriptions
- User-facing messages

## Implementation

When creating or modifying content:
1. Use "Sir" as the default honorific
2. Never use personal names unless specifically requested
3. Keep language gender-neutral and professional
4. Apply consistently across all frameworks

## Examples

**Instead of:**
```python
# Daniel will handle this error
```

**Use:**
```python
# Sir will handle this error
```

**Instead of:**
```markdown
## Daniel's Notes

This is Daniel's configuration file.
```

**Use:**
```markdown
## Notes

This configuration file is for Sir's use.
```
